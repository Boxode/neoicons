<p>All icons are preconfigured with a specific size and color. If you want to change these defaults it's just a matter of changing the classes to the ones you like following the styles of the <a href='https://tailwindcss.com'>TailwindCSS framework.</a></p>

> [!NOTE]\
> _This is an icons library, but it doesn't come as an `npm` package. Instead, you just copy and paste the code of the icon you need into your project, and customize them to fit your style._
